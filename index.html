            <h3>Harry Potter Series: Books</h3>
            <p>
              The novels fall into the genre of fantasy literature, and qualify
              as a type of fantasy called "urban fantasy", "contemporary
              fantasy", or "low fantasy". They are mainly dramas, and maintain a
              fairly serious and dark tone throughout, though they do contain
              some notable instances of tragicomedy and black humour. In many
              respects, they are also examples of the bildungsroman, or coming
              of age novel,[8] and contain elements of mystery, adventure,
              horror, thriller, and romance. The books are also, in the words of
              Stephen King, "shrewd mystery tales",[9] and each book is
              constructed in the manner of a Sherlock Holmes-style mystery
              adventure. The stories are told from a third person limited point
              of view with very few exceptions (such as the opening chapters of
              Philosopher's Stone, Goblet of Fire and Deathly Hallows and the
              first two chapters of Half-Blood Prince).

            <h3>Harry Potter Series: Movies</h3>
            <p>
              The series was mainly produced by David Heyman, and stars Daniel
              Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson as the three leading
              characters: Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger. Four
              directors worked on the series: Chris Columbus, Alfonso Cuarón,
              Mike Newell, and David Yates.[5] Michael Goldenberg wrote the
              screenplay for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007),
              while the remaining films' screenplays were written by Steve
              Kloves. Production took place over ten years, with the main story
              arc following Harry's quest to overcome his arch-enemy Lord
              Voldemort.[6] Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh
              and final novel in the series, was adapted into two feature-length
              parts.[7] Part 1 was released in November 2010, and Part 2 was
              released in July 2011.[8][9] Deathly Hallows – Part 1,
              Philosopher's Stone, and Deathly Hallows – Part 2 are among the 50
              highest-grossing films of all time, and ranking them as the 49th-,
              47th-, and 13th-highest-grossing films, with Philosopher's Stone
              and Deathly Hallows – Part 2 grossed over $1 billion. It is the
              fourth highest-grossing film series with $7.7 billion in worldwide
              receipts.
